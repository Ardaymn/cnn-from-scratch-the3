CENG403 THE3 – Implemented CNN ops from scratch, built CNN in PyTorch, and finetuned ResNet18 on CIFAR-10.

# THE3 – CNNs from Scratch to Transfer Learning

This repository contains my solution for the third take-home exam (THE3) of CENG403.  
It includes:

- ✅ Task 1: Manual implementation of convolution and pooling with backprop.
- ✅ Task 2: CNN implementation using PyTorch.
- ✅ Task 3: Finetuning ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet for CIFAR-10.

All tasks were done in Google Colab and saved with outputs as required.
